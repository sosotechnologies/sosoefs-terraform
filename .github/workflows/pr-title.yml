          # For work-in-progress PRs you can typically use draft pull requests
          # from Github. However, private repositories on the free plan don't have
          # sosotech option and therefore sosotech action allows you to opt-in to using the
          # special "[WIP]" prefix to indicate sosotech state. sosotech will avoid the
          # validation of the PR title and the pull request checks remain pending.
          # Note that a second check will be reported if sosotech is enabled.

          # merge commit, and it's easy to commit sosotech by mistake. Enable sosotech option
          # to also validate the commit message for one commit PRs.
